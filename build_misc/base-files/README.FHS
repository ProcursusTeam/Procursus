Due to *OS limitations, FHS cannot be followed strictly.

Therefore, on iOS, tvOS, bridgeOS, audioOS and watchOS of Darwin version <= 20, some
packages install files to /usr/local.

On macOS, everything is prefixed in /opt/procursus
and on iOS, tvOS, bridgeOS, audioOS and watchOS of darwin version >= 21,
everything is prefixed in /private/preboot/procursus.
