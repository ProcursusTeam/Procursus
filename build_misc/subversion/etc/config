### This file configures various client-side behaviors.
###
### The commented-out examples below are intended to demonstrate
### how to use this file.

### Section for authentication and authorization customizations.
[auth]
### Set password stores used by Subversion. They should be
### delimited by spaces or commas. The order of values determines
### the order in which password stores are used.
### Valid password stores:
###   gnome-keyring        (Unix-like systems)
###   kwallet              (Unix-like systems)
###   gpg-agent            (Unix-like systems)
###   keychain             (Mac OS X)
###   windows-cryptoapi    (Windows)
# password-stores = gpg-agent,gnome-keyring,kwallet
### To disable all password stores, use an empty list:
# password-stores =
###
### Set KWallet wallet used by Subversion. If empty or unset,
### then the default network wallet will be used.
# kwallet-wallet =
###
### Include PID (Process ID) in Subversion application name when
### using KWallet. It defaults to 'no'.
# kwallet-svn-application-name-with-pid = yes
###
### Set ssl-client-cert-file-prompt to 'yes' to cause the client
### to prompt for a path to a client cert file when the server
### requests a client cert but no client cert file is found in the
### expected place (see the 'ssl-client-cert-file' option in the
### 'servers' configuration file). Defaults to 'no'.
# ssl-client-cert-file-prompt = no
###
### The rest of the [auth] section in this file has been deprecated.
### Both 'store-passwords' and 'store-auth-creds' can now be
### specified in the 'servers' file in your config directory
### and are documented there. Anything specified in this section 
### is overridden by settings specified in the 'servers' file.
# store-passwords = no
# store-auth-creds = no

### Section for configuring external helper applications.
[helpers]
### Set editor-cmd to the command used to invoke your text editor.
###   This will override the environment variables that Subversion
###   examines by default to find this information ($EDITOR, 
###   et al).
# editor-cmd = editor (vi, emacs, notepad, etc.)
### Set diff-cmd to the absolute path of your 'diff' program.
###   This will override the compile-time default, which is to use
###   Subversion's internal diff implementation.
# diff-cmd = diff_program (diff, gdiff, etc.)
### Diff-extensions are arguments passed to an external diff
### program or to Subversion's internal diff implementation.
### Set diff-extensions to override the default arguments ('-u').
# diff-extensions = -u -p
### Set diff3-cmd to the absolute path of your 'diff3' program.
###   This will override the compile-time default, which is to use
###   Subversion's internal diff3 implementation.
# diff3-cmd = diff3_program (diff3, gdiff3, etc.)
### Set diff3-has-program-arg to 'yes' if your 'diff3' program
###   accepts the '--diff-program' option.
# diff3-has-program-arg = [yes | no]
### Set merge-tool-cmd to the command used to invoke your external
### merging tool of choice. Subversion will pass 5 arguments to
### the specified command: base theirs mine merged wcfile
# merge-tool-cmd = merge_command

### Section for configuring tunnel agents.
[tunnels]
### Configure svn protocol tunnel schemes here.  By default, only
### the 'ssh' scheme is defined.  You can define other schemes to
### be used with 'svn+scheme://hostname/path' URLs.  A scheme
### definition is simply a command, optionally prefixed by an
### environment variable name which can override the command if it
### is defined.  The command (or environment variable) may contain
### arguments, using standard shell quoting for arguments with
### spaces.  The command will be invoked as:
###   <command> <hostname> svnserve -t
### (If the URL includes a username, then the hostname will be
### passed to the tunnel agent as <user>@<hostname>.)  If the
### built-in ssh scheme were not predefined, it could be defined
### as:
# ssh = $SVN_SSH ssh -q -o ControlMaster=no --
### If you wanted to define a new 'rsh' scheme, to be used with
### 'svn+rsh:' URLs, you could do so as follows:
# rsh = rsh --
### Or, if you wanted to specify a full path and arguments:
# rsh = /path/to/rsh -l myusername --
### On Windows, if you are specifying a full path to a command,
### use a forward slash (/) or a paired backslash (\\) as the
### path separator.  A single backslash will be treated as an
### escape for the following character.

### Section for configuring miscellaneous Subversion options.
[miscellany]
### Set global-ignores to a set of whitespace-delimited globs
### which Subversion will ignore in its 'status' output, and
### while importing or adding files and directories.
### '*' matches leading dots, e.g. '*.rej' matches '.foo.rej'.
# global-ignores = *.o *.lo *.la *.al .libs *.so *.so.[0-9]* *.a *.pyc *.pyo __pycache__
#   *.rej *~ #*# .#* .*.swp .DS_Store [Tt]humbs.db
### Set log-encoding to the default encoding for log messages
# log-encoding = latin1
### Set use-commit-times to make checkout/update/switch/revert
### put last-committed timestamps on every file touched.
# use-commit-times = yes
### Set no-unlock to prevent 'svn commit' from automatically
### releasing locks on files.
# no-unlock = yes
### Set mime-types-file to a MIME type registry file, used to
### provide hints to Subversion's MIME type auto-detection
### algorithm.
# mime-types-file = /path/to/mime.types
### Set preserved-conflict-file-exts to a whitespace-delimited
### list of patterns matching file extensions which should be
### preserved in generated conflict file names.  By default,
### conflict files use custom extensions.
# preserved-conflict-file-exts = doc ppt xls od?
### Set enable-auto-props to 'yes' to enable automatic properties
### for 'svn add' and 'svn import', it defaults to 'no'.
### Automatic properties are defined in the section 'auto-props'.
# enable-auto-props = yes
### Set interactive-conflicts to 'no' to disable interactive
### conflict resolution prompting.  It defaults to 'yes'.
# interactive-conflicts = no
### Set memory-cache-size to define the size of the memory cache
### used by the client when accessing a FSFS repository via
### ra_local (the file:// scheme). The value represents the number
### of MB used by the cache.
# memory-cache-size = 16
### Set diff-ignore-content-type to 'yes' to cause 'svn diff' to
### attempt to show differences of all modified files regardless
### of their MIME content type.  By default, Subversion will only
### attempt to show differences for files believed to have human-
### readable (non-binary) content.  This option is especially
### useful when Subversion is configured (via the 'diff-cmd'
### option) to employ an external differencing tool which is able
### to show meaningful differences for binary file formats.  [New
### in 1.9]
# diff-ignore-content-type = no

### Section for configuring automatic properties.
[auto-props]
### The format of the entries is:
###   file-name-pattern = propname[=value][;propname[=value]...]
### The file-name-pattern can contain wildcards (such as '*' and
### '?').  All entries which match (case-insensitively) will be
### applied to the file.  Note that auto-props functionality
### must be enabled, which is typically done by setting the
### 'enable-auto-props' option.
# *.c = svn:eol-style=native
# *.cpp = svn:eol-style=native
# *.h = svn:keywords=Author Date Id Rev URL;svn:eol-style=native
# *.dsp = svn:eol-style=CRLF
# *.dsw = svn:eol-style=CRLF
# *.sh = svn:eol-style=native;svn:executable
# *.txt = svn:eol-style=native;svn:keywords=Author Date Id Rev URL;
# *.png = svn:mime-type=image/png
# *.jpg = svn:mime-type=image/jpeg
# Makefile = svn:eol-style=native

### Section for configuring working copies.
[working-copy]
### Set to a list of the names of specific clients that should use
### exclusive SQLite locking of working copies.  This increases the
### performance of the client but prevents concurrent access by
### other clients.  Third-party clients may also support this
### option.
### Possible values:
###   svn                (the command line client)
# exclusive-locking-clients =
### Set to true to enable exclusive SQLite locking of working
### copies by all clients using the 1.8 APIs.  Enabling this may
### cause some clients to fail to work properly. This does not have
### to be set for exclusive-locking-clients to work.
# exclusive-locking = false
### Set the SQLite busy timeout in milliseconds: the maximum time
### the client waits to get access to the SQLite database before
### returning an error.  The default is 10000, i.e. 10 seconds.
### Longer values may be useful when exclusive locking is enabled.
# busy-timeout = 10000
