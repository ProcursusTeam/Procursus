Description: incremental parsing system for programming tools (development files)
 Tree-sitter is a parser generator tool and an incremental parsing library. It
 can build a concrete syntax tree for a source file and efficiently update the
 syntax tree as the source file is edited.
 .
 Tree-sitter aims to be:
 .
  * General enough to parse any programming language
  * Fast enough to parse on every keystroke in a text editor
  * Robust enough to provide useful results even in the presence of
    syntax errors
  * Dependency-free so that the runtime library (which is written in pure
    C) can be embedded in any application
 .
 This package contains the header files and libraries needed for developing
