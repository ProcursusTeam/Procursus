Description: X11 Screen Saver extension library
 libXss provides an X Window System client interface to the MIT-SCREEN-SAVER extension to the X protocol.
 .
 The Screen Saver extension allows clients behaving as screen savers to register themselves with the X server, to better integrate themselves with the running session.
