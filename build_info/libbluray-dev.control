Description: Blu-ray disc playback support library (development files)
 libbluray is an open-source library designed for Blu-Ray Discs playback for
 media players, like VLC or MPlayer. This research project is developed by an
 international team of developers from Doom9. libbluray integrates navigation,
 playlist parsing, menus, and BD-J.
 .
 NB: Most commercial Blu-Ray are restricted by AACS or BD+ technologies and this
 library is not enough to playback those discs.
 .
 This package provides the necessary files needed for development.
