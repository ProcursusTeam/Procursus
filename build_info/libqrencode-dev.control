Description: development files for the QR Code encoding library
 libqrencode is a fast and compact library for encoding 
 data in a QR Code, a 2D symbology that can be scanned by
 handy terminals such as a smartphone. The capacity of 
 QR Code is up to 7000 digits or 4000 characters and has 
 high robustness.
 .
 libqrencode accepts a string or a list of data chunks then
 encodes in a QR Code symbol as a bitmap array. While other 
 QR Code applications generate an image file, using libqrencode 
 allows applications to render QR Code symbols from raw bitmap 
 data directly.
 .
 This package contains the header and development files.
