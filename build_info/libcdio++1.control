Description: C++ library to read and control CD-ROM.
 This C++ library is to encapsulate CD-ROM reading and control. Applications
 wishing to be oblivious of the OS- and device-dependant properties of a CD-ROM
 can use this library. Some support for disk image types like BIN/CUE and NRG is available,
 so applications that use this library also have the ability to read disc images as though
 they were CD's.
