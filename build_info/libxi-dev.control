Description: X11 Input extension library (development headers)
 libXi provides an X Window System client interface to the XINPUT
 extension to the X protocol.
 .
 The Input extension allows setup and configuration of multiple input devices,
 and hotplugging of input devices (to be added and removed on the fly).
 .
 This package contains the development headers for the library found in
 libxi6.  Non-developers likely have little use for this package.
