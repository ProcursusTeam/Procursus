Description: command-line HTML processor
 Pup is a command-line tool for processing HTML. It
 reads from stdin, prints to stdout, and allows the
 user to filter parts of the page using CSS selectors.
 .
 Inspired by jq (http://stedolan.github.io/jq/), pup aims to be
 a fast and flexible way of exploring HTML from the terminal.
