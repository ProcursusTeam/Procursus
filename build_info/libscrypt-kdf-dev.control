Description: Development library for encryption using scrypt for key derivation
 A simple password-based encryption utility which demonstrates the
 scrypt key derivation function.  On modern hardware and with default
 parameters, the cost of cracking the password on a file encrypted by
 scrypt enc is approximately 100 billion times more than the cost of
 cracking the same password on a file encrypted by openssl enc; this
 means that a five-character password using scrypt is stronger than a
 ten-character password using openssl.
