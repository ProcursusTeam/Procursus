Description: API to help with the construction and injection of network packets.
 Libnet is an API to help with the construction and injection of network packets. 
 It provides a portable framework for low-level network packet writing and handling (use libnet in conjunction with libpcap and you can write some really cool stuff). 
 Libnet includes packet creation at the IP layer and at the link layer as well as a host of supplementary and complementary functionality.
