Description: Development files for the GeoIP library
 GeoIP is a C library that enables the user to find the country that any
 IP address or hostname originates from. It uses a file based database.
 .
 This database simply contains IP blocks as keys, and countries as values and
 it should be more complete and accurate than using reverse DNS lookups.
 .
 This package contains the development files.
