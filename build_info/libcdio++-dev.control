Description: C++ library to read and control CD-ROM (development files).
 This package contains development files (headers and static library) for the
 libcdio++ library. This library is to encapsulate CD-ROM reading and control.
 Applications wishing to be oblivious of the OS- and device-dependant properties
 of a CD-ROM can use this library. Some support for disk image types like BIN/CUE
 and NRG is available, so applications that use this library also have the ability
 to read disc images as though they were CD's.
