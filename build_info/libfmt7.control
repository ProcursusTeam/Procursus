Description: fast type-safe C++ formatting library -- library
 This library provides fast, type-safe, small, C++11-aware replacement of
 (s)printf and related machinery. In some cases it's noticeably faster
 than boost::format, boost::lexical_cast and even sprintf itself.
 .
 This package contains the shared library.
