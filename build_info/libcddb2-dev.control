Description: development files for libcddb.
 libcddb is a C library to access data about Audio CD
 on a CDDB server. It allows one to search the database
 for CD matches, get detailed information about a CD and
 submit new CD entries to the database. It supports both
 the custom CDDB protocol and the tunneling of the query
 over HTTP. HTTP Proxying is supported. It also features a
 cache system. This package contains the header files and
 static library needed to compile applications that use
 libcddb.
