Description: development files for libcdio
 This library is to encapsulate CD-ROM reading and control. Applications wishing to be oblivious of the OS- and device-dependant properties of a CD-ROM can use this library.
 .
 Some support for disk image types like BIN/CUE and NRG is available, so applications that use this library also have the ability to read disc images as though they were CD's.
 .
 This package contains the header files and static library needed to compile applications that use libcdio.
