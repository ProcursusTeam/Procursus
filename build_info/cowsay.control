Description: configurable talking cow
 Cowsay (or cowthink) will turn text into happy ASCII cows, with
 speech (or thought) balloons. If you don't like cows, ASCII art is
 available to replace it with some other creatures (Tux, the BSD
 daemon, dragons, and a plethora of animals, from a turkey to
 an elephant in a snake).
