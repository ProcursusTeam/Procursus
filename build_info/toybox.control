Description: all-in-one Darwin command line
 toybox is a multicall binary, a "swiss-army-knife" program 
 that acts differently depending on the name it was called by (cp, mv, cat...).
 .
 The special "toybox" command treats its first argument as the command to run.
 With no arguments, it lists available commands. This allows you to use toybox
 without installing it, and is the only command that can have an arbitrary
 suffix.
 .
 The "help" command provides information about each command (ala "help cat"),
 and "help toybox" provides general information about toybox.
