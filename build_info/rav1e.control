Description: Fastest and safest AV1 video encoder
 The fastest and safest AV1 encoder.
 .
 rav1e is an AV1 video encoder. It is designed to eventually cover all use cases, 
 though in its current form it is most suitable for cases where libaom (the reference encoder) is too slow.
 .
 * Intra, inter, and switch frames
 * 64x64 superblocks
 * 4x4 to 64x64 RDO-selected square and 2:1/1:2 rectangular blocks
 * DC, H, V, Paeth, smooth, and all directional prediction modes
 * DCT, (FLIP-)ADST and identity transforms (up to 64x64, 16x16 and 32x32 respectively)
 * 8-, 10- and 12-bit depth color
 * 4:2:0 (full support), 4:2:2 and 4:4:4 (limited) chroma sampling
 * 11 speed settings (0-10)
 * Near real-time encoding at high speed levels
 * Constant quantizer and target bitrate (single- and multi-pass) encoding modes
 * Still picture mode
 .
 The speed claims might not hold up with this package as the assembly is not included.

 This package contains the command line tool.
