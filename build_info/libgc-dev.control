Description: conservative garbage collector for C and C++
  Boehm-Demers-Weiser's GC is a garbage collecting storage allocator
  that is intended to be used as a plug-in replacement for C's malloc
  or C++'s new().
  .
  It allows you to allocate memory basically as you normally would
  without explicitly deallocating memory that is no longer useful.
  The collector automatically recycles memory when it determines that
  it can no longer be used.
  .
  This version of the collector is thread safe, has C++ support and
  uses the defaults for everything else. However, it does not work as
  a drop-in malloc(3) replacement.
  .
  This package is required to compile and link programs that use
  libgc1.
