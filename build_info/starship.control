 To activate starship, add the following to the end of your ~/.zshrc:
 eval "$(starship init zsh)"

 To be able to see the glyphs that starship shows you need a nerd font installed and enabled in your terminal.
 If you are connecting from another machine the font will need to be enabled on that machine.
 On iOS:
 * ... the font in MTerminal is incompatible
 * ... in NewTerm all fonts apart from the Menlo and SF Mono fonts are compatible
 * ... all fonts in the Blink Shell app are compatible
 * ... in Terminus all fonts with Powerline in the name are compatible
 * ... other SSH/MOSH clients and terminals have not been tested yet
