Description: Extremely fast hash algorithm
 xxHash is an Extremely fast Hash algorithm, running at RAM speed limits.
 It successfully completes the SMHasher test suite which evaluates collision,
 dispersion and randomness qualities of hash functions. Code is highly portable,
 and hashes are identical on all platforms (little / big endian).
