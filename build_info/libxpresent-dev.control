Description: X11 Present extension library (development headers)
 libXpresent provides an X Window System client interface to the Present
 extension to the X protocol.
 .
 The Present extension provides a way for applications to update their
 window contents from a pixmap in a well defined fashion, synchronizing
 with the display refresh and potentially using a more efficient mechanism
 than copying the contents of the source pixmap.
 .
 This package contains the development headers for the library found in 
 libxpresent1. Non-developers likely have little use for this package.
 .
