Description: Open source MPEG-4 video codec (development)

 It is written in C with assembler optimizations for quality and speed
 (including MMX, SSE, and 3Dnow! code for i386 and AltiVec for PowerPC), and is
 especially optimized towards offline, multi-pass compression for storage and
 archival purposes.
