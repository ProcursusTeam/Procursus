Description: New Perl Compatible Regular Expression Library - posix-compatible runtime files
 This is PCRE2, the new implementation of PCRE, a library of functions
 to support regular expressions whose syntax and semantics are as
 close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language. New projects
 should use this library in preference to the older library.
 .
 This package contains the runtime library for the posix-compatible API.
