Description: cross-platform audio input and output library
 libsoundio is a lightweight abstraction over various sound drivers. It provides
 a well-documented API that operates consistently regardless of the sound driver
 it connects to. It performs no buffering or processing on your behalf; instead
 exposing the raw power of the underlying backend.
 .
 libsoundio is appropriate for games, music players, digital audio workstations,
 and various utilities.
 .
 libsoundio is serious about robustness. It even handles out of memory
 conditions correctly.
 .
 This package contains the development files.
