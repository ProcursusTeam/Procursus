Description: DEC SIXEL graphics codec implementation (develop)
 SIXEL is one of image formats for printer and terminal imaging
 introduced by Digital Equipment Corp. (DEC). Its data scheme is
 represented as a terminal-friendly escape sequence. 
 So if you want to view a SIXEL image file, all you have to do
 is "cat" it to your terminal.
 .
 The package is for development.
