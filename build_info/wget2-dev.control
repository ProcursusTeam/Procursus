Description: development file for wget2
 GNU Wget is a network utility to retrieve files from the web 
 using HTTP(S) and FTP, the two most widely used internet protocols.
 It works non-interactively, so it will work in the background, after 
 having logged off. The program supports recursive retrieval of 
 web-authoring pages as well as FTP sites -- you can use Wget to 
 make mirrors of archives and home pages or to travel the web 
 like a WWW robot.
 .
 These are the development files to build software with libwget.
