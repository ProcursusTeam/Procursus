Description: BSD manpage compiler toolset
 mandoc is a suite of tools compiling mdoc, the roff macro language
 of choice for BSD manual pages, and man, the predominant historical
 language for UNIX manuals. It is small, ISO C, ISC-licensed, and
 quite fast. The main component of the toolset is the mandoc utility
 program, based on the libmandoc validating compiler, to format
 output for UNIX terminals (with support for wide-character locales),
 XHTML, HTML, PostScript, and PDF.
