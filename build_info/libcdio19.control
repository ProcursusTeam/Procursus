Description: library to read and control CD-ROM.
 This library is to encapsulate CD-ROM reading and control. Applications
 wishing to be oblivious of the OS- and device-dependant properties of a
 CD-ROM can use this library. Some support for disk image types like BIN/CUE
 and NRG is available, so applications that use this library also have the ability
 to read disc images as though they were CD's. This package contains the libcdio 
 runtime library.
