Description: Perl module for parsing XML files
 The XML::Parser module provides ways to parse XML documents.  It is built on
 top of XML::Parser::Expat, which is a lower level interface to James Clark's
 expat library. Each call to one of the parsing methods creates a new instance
 of XML::Parser::Expat which is then used to parse the document. Expat options
 may be provided when the XML::Parser object is created. These options are
 then passed on to the Expat object on each parse call. They can also be given
 as extra arguments to the parse methods, in which case they override options
 given at XML::Parser creation time.
 .
 The behavior of the parser is controlled either by Style and/or Handlers
 options, or by setHandlers method. These all provide mechanisms for
 XML::Parser to set the handlers needed by XML::Parser::Expat. If neither
 Style nor Handlers are specified, then parsing just checks the document for
 being well-formed.
 .
 When underlying handlers get called, they receive as their first parameter
 the Expat object, not the Parser object.
