Description: X transport library (development files)
 xtrans includes a number of routines to make X implementations
 transport-independent; at time of writing, it includes support for UNIX
 sockets, IPv4, IPv6, and DECnet.
 .
 xtrans is not actually a library in itself; it includes .c files which are
 then used in the compilation of X servers, libraries, et al.
