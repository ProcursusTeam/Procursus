Description: recursively lists package dependencies
  This utility can recursively list package dependencies, either forwards or in reverse. 
  It also lists forward build-dependencies. The output format closely resembles that of `apt-cache depends`. 
  As well, it can generate .dot graphs, much like apt-cache in dotty mode.
