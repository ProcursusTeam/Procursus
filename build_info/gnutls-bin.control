Description: GNU TLS library - commandline utilities
 GnuTLS is a portable library which implements the Transport Layer
 Security (TLS 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3) and Datagram
 Transport Layer Security (DTLS 1.0, 1.2) protocols.
 .
 GnuTLS features support for:
  - certificate path validation, as well as DANE and trust on first use.
  - the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP).
  - public key methods, including RSA and Elliptic curves, as well as password
    and key authentication methods such as SRP and PSK protocols.
  - all the strong encryption algorithms, including AES and Camellia.
  - CPU-assisted cryptography with VIA padlock and AES-NI instruction sets.
  - HSMs and cryptographic tokens, via PKCS #11.
 .
 This package contains a commandline interface to the GNU TLS library, which
 can be used to set up secure connections from e.g. shell scripts, debugging
 connection issues or managing certificates.
 .
 Useful utilities include:
  - TLS termination: gnutls-cli, gnutls-serv
  - key and certificate management: certtool, ocsptool, p11tool
  - credential management: srptool, psktool
