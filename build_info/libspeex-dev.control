Description: The Speex codec library development files
 Speex is an audio codec especially designed for compressing voice at low
 bit-rates for applications such as voice over IP (VoIP). In some senses,
 it is meant to be complementary to the Vorbis codec which places a greater
 emphasis on high-quality music reproduction.
 .
 This package provides the speex library headers and development files.
