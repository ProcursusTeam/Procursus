Description: FFmpeg library for handling input and output devices - development files
 FFmpeg is the leading multimedia framework, able to decode, encode, transcode,
 mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much anything that humans and
 machines have created. It supports the most obscure ancient formats up to the
 cutting edge.
 .
 This library provides a generic framework for grabbing from and rendering to
 many common multimedia input/output devices, and supports several input and
 output devices, including Video4Linux2, VfW, DShow, and ALSA.
 .
 This package contains the development files.
