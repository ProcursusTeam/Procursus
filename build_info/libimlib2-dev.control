Description: image loading, rendering, saving library (development files)
 Imlib2 is a library that does image file loading and saving as well as
 rendering, manipulation, arbitrary polygon support, etc.
 .
 It does ALL of these operations FAST. Imlib2 also tries to be highly
 intelligent about doing them, so writing naive programs can be done easily,
 without sacrificing speed.
 .
 This package provides the development files (ie. includes, static library,
 manual pages) that allow one to build software which uses imlib2.
