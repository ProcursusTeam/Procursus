Description: FFmpeg library with (de)muxers for multimedia containers - runtime files
 FFmpeg is the leading multimedia framework, able to decode, encode, transcode,
 mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much anything that humans and
 machines have created. It supports the most obscure ancient formats up to the
 cutting edge.
 .
 This library provides a generic framework for multiplexing and demultiplexing
 (muxing and demuxing) audio, video and subtitle streams. It encompasses
 multiple muxers and demuxers for multimedia container formats. It also
 supports several input and output protocols to access a media resource.
 .
 This package contains the runtime files.
