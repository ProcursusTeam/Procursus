Description: X11 Record extension library (development headers)
 libXtst provides an X Window System client interface to the Record
 extension to the X protocol.
 .
 The Record extension allows X clients to synthesise input events, which
 is useful for automated testing.
 .
 This package contains the development headers for the library found in
 libxtst6.  Non-developers likely have little use for this package.
