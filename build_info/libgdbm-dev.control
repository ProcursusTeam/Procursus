Description: GNU dbm database routines (development files) 
 GNU dbm ('gdbm') is a library of database functions that use extendible
 hashing and works similarly to the standard UNIX 'dbm' functions.
 .
 The basic use of 'gdbm' is to store key/data pairs in a data file, thus
 providing a persistent version of the 'dictionary' Abstract Data Type
 ('hash' to perl programmers).
 .
 Note, that to build old programs, that use legacy 'dbm' interface,
 you have to install libgdbm-compat-dev binary package.
