Description: development files for CommonMark parsing and rendering library
 cmark is the C reference implementation of CommonMark,
 a rationalized version of Markdown syntax with a spec.
 .
 cmark parses almost as fast as sundown and hoedown
 (but safer and less buggy),
 about 3 times faster than discount,
 and about 100 times faster than kramdown and pandoc.
 Memory consumption is on par with sundown
 and about 10 times less than pandoc.
 .
 cmark outputs HTML, groff man, LaTeX, CommonMark,
 and a custom XML format.
 .
 Markdown is a lightweight markup language
 with plain-text-formatting syntax.
 .
 This package contains the header and development files.
