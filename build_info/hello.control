Description: example package based on GNU hello
 The GNU hello program produces a familiar, friendly greeting. It allows non-programmers to use a classic computer science tool which would otherwise be unavailable to them.
 Seriously, though: this is an example of how to do a Procursus package. It is the Procursus version of the GNU Project's `hello world' program (which is itself an example for the GNU Project).
