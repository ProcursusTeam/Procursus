Description: Executing commands in parallel
 The main purpose of pexec is to execute the given command in parallel on the local host or on remote hosts, while some of the execution parameters, namely the redirected standard input, output or error and environmental variables can be varied. The capabilities of the program are extended with additional features, such as allowing to define mutual exclusions, do atomic command executions and implement higher level resource and job control. The maximum number of simultaneous tasks can be controlled by a hypervisor daemon: with such a daemon, concurrent pexec instances can be launched without an unexpectedly high load.
