Description: QEMU full system emulation binaries (mips)
 QEMU is a fast processor emulator: currently the package supports
 ARM emulation. By using dynamic translation it achieves
 reasonable speed while being easy to port on new host CPUs.
 .
 This package provides the full system emulation binaries to emulate
 the following mips hardware: mips, mipsel, mips64, mips64el.
 .
 In system emulation mode QEMU emulates a full system, including a processor
 and various peripherals.  It enables easier testing and debugging of system
 code.  It can also be used to provide virtual hosting of several virtual
 machines on a single server.
