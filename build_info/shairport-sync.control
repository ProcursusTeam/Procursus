Description: AirPlay audio player
 Plays audio streamed from iTunes, iOS devices and third-party AirPlay
 sources such as ForkedDaapd and others. Audio played by a Shairport
 Sync-powered device stays synchronised with the source and hence with
 similar devices playing the same source. In this way, synchronised
 multi-room audio is possible without difficulty.
 .
 Shairport Sync does not support AirPlay video or photo streaming.
