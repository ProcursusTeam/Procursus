Description: Development files for PAM
 Contains C header files and development libraries for libpam, the Pluggable
 Authentication Modules, a library that enables the local system
 administrator to choose how applications authenticate users.
 .
 PAM decouples applications from the authentication mechanism, making it
 possible to upgrade the authentication system without recompiling or
 rewriting the applications.
