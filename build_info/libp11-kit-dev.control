Description: library for loading and coordinating access to PKCS#11 modules - development
 The p11-kit library provides a way to load and enumerate Public-Key
 Cryptography Standard #11 modules, along with a standard configuration
 setup for installing PKCS#11 modules so that they're discoverable. It
 also solves problems with coordinating the use of PKCS#11 by different
 components or libraries living in the same process.
 .
 This package contains the documentation and development headers required
 to build applications using the p11-kit library.
