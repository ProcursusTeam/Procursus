Description: Old Perl 5 Compatible Regular Expression Library - development files
 This is a library of functions to support regular expressions whose syntax 
 and semantics are as close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language.
 .
 New packages should use the newer pcre2 packages, and existing
 packages should migrate to pcre2.
 .
 This package contains the development files, including headers, static 
 libraries, and documentation.
